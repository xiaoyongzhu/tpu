# Running RetinaNet using "Object Detection" APIs and GPUs

This repository is a fork of the TensorFlow TPU repository (https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu) and the goal is to reuse the RetinaNet model with TensorFlow Object Detection API. Please go directly to the [RetinaNet folder](models/official/retinanet) for more details on what I have modified.





# Original README
# Cloud TPUs #

This repository is a collection of reference models and tools used with
[Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/).

The fastest way to get started training a model on a Cloud TPU is by following
the tutorial. Click the button below to launch the tutorial using Google Cloud
Shell.
